// Task Description
// As input youâ€™ll be given the coordinates of the dogs.
// Your task is to find the distance to the nearest point
// from which you can kill the maximum number of animals with one shot
// (any number of dogs on the same line can be killed with one shot).
// Your starting position is the point (0, 0).
// If the calculated distance is an integer, return it as int, otherwise round it to 2 decimal places.

// Test Cases:
wildDogs([[7, 122], [8, 139], [9, 156], [10, 173], [11, 190], [-100, 1]]); // 0.18

wildDogs([[6, -0.5], [3, -5], [1, -20]]); // 3.63

wildDogs([[10, 10], [13, 13], [21, 18]]); // 0
