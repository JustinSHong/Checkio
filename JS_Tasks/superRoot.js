// Task Description
// Square roots, cube roots, 4th roots... each one of them is too boring for Nicola.
// He needs to find the super root! With your help he'll almost certainly achieve this goal.

// The super root of a number N is the number x, such that xx = N.
// The result should be accurate, so that x**x ≈ N±0.001, or N - 0.001 < x**x < N + 0.001.

// Input: A number (N) as an integer.
// Output: The super root (x) as a float or an integer.

// Test Cases:
superRoot(4); // 2;
superRoot(27); // 3;
superRoot(81); // 3.504339593597054;
